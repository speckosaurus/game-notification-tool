Game Notification Tool is a wip desktop tool which reads data from an Excel spreadsheet and reminds you if a new game is coming out within 7 days

The Release and Debug folders contain "Game Watch List.xlsx" where you can add data about any upcoming video games that you want to keep track of.

Note: the Excel file must exist in the same folder as the .exe in order to run

You can make sure the tool runs automatically every day you log onto your computer by creating a scheduled task in the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/schedule-task#1TC=windows-7">Windows Task Scheduler</a>
